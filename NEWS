gapctd 2.0.0 (October 19, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This release includes substantial changes to data processing 
functions in order to process data from SBE43 dissolved oxygen 
and SBE18 pH sensors.

NEW FEATURES

- Modifications were made to numerous core functions to handle
  data from dissolved oxygen and pH channels while retaining 
  functionality when the sensors are not used.
  
- derive_oxygen(): Converts SBE43 voltage into oxygen (ml/l)
  using calibration parameters for the DO sensors. Currently 
  allows tau correction to voltage but not the hysteresis correct-
  ion. References:

- extract_calibration_xmlcon(): Extracts calibration parameters 
  for temperature, pressure, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and 
  pH sensors from a CTD configuration (.xmlcon) file.
  
- align_oxygen(): Aligns oxygen channel data using user-specified
  offset value.

- wrapper_align_oxygen(): Aligns oxygen for multiple user-specified 
  alignment offset values using align_oxygen().
  
- select_best_oxygen_method(): Similar to select_best_method()
  for temperature/salinity/density, an interface for users to 
  select the best oxygen alignment value based on visual inspection 
  of oxygen profiles.
  
- review_oxygen_ph_profiles(): Similar to review_profiles() for
  temperature/salinity/density, an interface for users to select
  oxygen and pH profiles to include in the final data product.

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- qc_flag_interpolate(): Allows "oxygen" and "ph" as arguments
  to 'review'
	
- .check_duplicates: Internal (AFSC) use. Checks hex files for
	duplicate casts and multiple serial numbers to avoid processing
	errors.
	

gapctd 1.5.1 (September 22, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- New error check for the Temperature-Salinity Error method in run_gapctd() to handle 
  cases where the temperature-salinity area method doesn't converge because 
  temperature-salinity curves from upcasts and downcasts produce identical values.
  
- Added internal function to gapctd workflow to check for duplicate casts and multiple CTDs in 
  /data/ to avoid data processing errors.
