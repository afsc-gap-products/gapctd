gapctd 2.1.0 (December 4, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

- Added a window_filter() function the implements SBEDP methods 
  for boxcar, cosine, triangle, and Gaussian window filters.

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- Removed SBE Data Processing workflow functions from the package
  due to lack of capacity to support parallel development. However,
  processing methods will be implemented.
- hex_to_cnv() now expects default arguments for output_channels
  and output_sig_digits.
  
BUG FIX

- Replaced instances where the default buoyancy frequency threshold
  for density inversion checks was -1e-4 with the correct default
  value of -1e-5, based on PMEL protocols.

IMPROVEMENTS

- Removed purrr, tibble, and stringr from dependencies and imports.


gapctd 2.0.2 (November 10, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

IMPROVEMENTS

- Change section_oce() to allow sectioning when there are no 
  pressure data.
- Add error check to bin_average() for cases when there are no 
  data quality flags.


gapctd 2.0.1 (October 20, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIX

- Change filepath handling in align_oxygen() to use relative path
  naming. This change allows the user to move the data processing 
  directory between setup and oxygen alignment steps.
  
IMPROVEMENTS

- Make qc_flag_interpolate() display oxygen units during flag/
  interpolate step.
  

gapctd 2.0.0 (October 19, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This release includes substantial changes to data processing 
functions in order to process data from SBE43 dissolved oxygen 
and SBE18 pH sensors.

NEW FEATURES

- Modifications were made to numerous core functions to handle
  data from dissolved oxygen and pH channels while retaining 
  functionality when the sensors are not used.
  
- derive_oxygen(): Converts SBE43 voltage into oxygen (ml/l)
  using calibration parameters for the DO sensors. Currently 
  allows tau correction to voltage but not the hysteresis correct-
  ion. References:

- extract_calibration_xmlcon(): Extracts calibration parameters 
  for temperature, pressure, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and 
  pH sensors from a CTD configuration (.xmlcon) file.
  
- align_oxygen(): Aligns oxygen channel data using user-specified
  offset value.

- wrapper_align_oxygen(): Aligns oxygen for multiple user-specified 
  alignment offset values using align_oxygen().
  
- select_best_oxygen_method(): Similar to select_best_method()
  for temperature/salinity/density, an interface for users to 
  select the best oxygen alignment value based on visual inspection 
  of oxygen profiles.
  
- review_oxygen_ph_profiles(): Similar to review_profiles() for
  temperature/salinity/density, an interface for users to select
  oxygen and pH profiles to include in the final data product.

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- qc_flag_interpolate(): Allows "oxygen" and "ph" as arguments
  to 'review'
	
- .check_duplicates: Internal (AFSC) use. Checks hex files for
	duplicate casts and multiple serial numbers to avoid processing
	errors.
	

gapctd 1.5.1 (September 22, 2023)
----------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

- New error check for the Temperature-Salinity Error method in 
  run_gapctd() to handle cases where the temperature-salinity 
  area method doesn't converge because temperature-salinity curves 
  from upcasts and downcasts produce identical values.
  
- Added internal function to gapctd workflow to check for duplicate 
  casts and multiple CTDs in /data/ to avoid data processing errors.
